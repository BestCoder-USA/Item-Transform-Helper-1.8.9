# Item Transform Helper
## Description
### When you create a custom item, you need to provide ItemCameraTransforms for it. This project is an interactive tool to help you get the transforms right by interactively adjusting them.

## How to use:

- Place the Camera item somewhere in the player's hotbar
- Hold the Item you want to modify in the player's hand
- Use the up/down keys to move up and down the menu.
- Use the left/right keys to edit the value (e.g. scaleX)
- To select a different view (e.g. first person, third person) use left/right to change the VIEW menu item.
- To modify the transform for an item on the ground:
- Throw your Item onto the ground, and then put another copy of your Item into the player's hand
- Use left/right to change the VIEW menu item to grnd
- Use the same technique for items in the gui, on your head (eg pumpkin), fixed (in picture frames), or in the player's left hand.
